Import CSS styles from NPM modules using [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).

This lets you use `@import` CSS using the same rules you use for `require` in Node. Specify the CSS file for a module using the `style` field in `package.json` and use `@import "my-module";`, or specify the file name in the module, like `@import "my-module/my-file";`. You can also require files relative to the current file using `@import "./my-file";`.

An `@import` will be processed so that the file referenced will have been imported in the current scope at the point of the `@import`. If a file has been previously imported in the current scope, that file will not be imported again. New scopes are created in a block such as a `@media` block. Child blocks will not duplicate imports that have been imported in the parent block, but may duplicate imports that are imported in a sibling block (since they may not have effect otherwise).

You can use source maps to show which file a definition originated from when debugging in a browser. To include inline source maps, use `.toString({ sourcemap: true })` on the rework object when generating the output.

Note that to get correct import paths you must set the `source` option to the source file name when parsing the CSS source (usually with rework). If the `source` path is relative, it is resolved to the `root` option (defaults to the current directory). The `source` path is used to find the directory to start in when finding dependencies.
